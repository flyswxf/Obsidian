- The choice of what models to create has a profound influence on how a problem is attacked and how a solution is shaped
- Every model may be expressed at different levels of precision.
- The best models are connected to reality.
- No single model or view is sufficient. Every nontrivial system is best approached through a small set of nearly independent models with multiple viewpoints
